# Star Trek AI-Generated Fanfic Planning Document

## Core Premise
A malfunctioning artificial consciousness experiences reality-bending hallucinations after exposure to quantum radiation, leading to increasingly bizarre and genre-defying scenarios.

## Potential Protagonists
1. **Data Option**
   - Exposed to quantum radiation during a routine survey mission
   - His positronic brain begins generating unpredictable narrative threads
   - Struggles to distinguish reality from his corrupted subroutines
   - Could involve holodeck malfunctions for extra chaos

2. **The Doctor (EMH) Option**
   - Mobile emitter gets hit by quantum surge
   - His program starts generating random story branches
   - More meta potential since he's already a hologram
   - Could incorporate his love of opera and storytelling

## Narrative Structure
- Frame story: Normal Star Trek episode opening
- Incident with quantum radiation
- Reality begins to fragment
- Multiple nested/branching storylines
- Increasingly absurd genre shifts
- Possible tropes to corrupt:
  - Time loops
  - Mirror universe
  - Holodeck malfunction
  - Space anomalies
  - Alien possession

## Potential Plot Elements
1. Character suddenly finds themselves in different TV genres
   - Soap opera version of the bridge
   - Film noir engineering section
   - Musical number in Ten Forward
   - Reality TV confessionals

2. Meta elements
   - Breaking the fourth wall
   - Commentary on Star Trek tropes
   - Mixed-up catchphrases
   - Crossovers with other sci-fi properties

3. Technical "Explanations"
   - Technobabble that becomes increasingly nonsensical
   - Multiple conflicting solutions
   - Problems that solve themselves for no reason
   - Deus ex machina involving reversing the polarity

## AI Generation Approach
1. Feed the LLM:
   - Star Trek episode scripts
   - Various genre conventions
   - Classic sci-fi tropes
   - Technical manual excerpts

2. Potential Prompting Strategies:
   - Generate alternative timeline branches
   - Create genre-specific scene variations
   - Develop increasingly corrupted technobabble
   - Mix and match character dialogues

## Resolution Options
1. Everything returns to normal
   - But was it really just a malfunction?
   - Small glitches remain
   - Character retains some memories

2. Meta ending
   - Breaking simulation
   - Recursive loop
   - Multiple simultaneous endings

## Notes
- Embrace the inherent chaos of AI generation
- Use quantum uncertainty as plot device
- Don't try to make it make sense
- Let the AI go wild with crossovers and references
- Include classic Trek elements but corrupted
