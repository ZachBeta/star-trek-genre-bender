# Chapter 1: The Incident

Lieutenant Commander Data's fingers moved with inhuman precision across the ops console of the Enterprise-D, their rhythmic tapping a familiar sound on the bridge. Captain Picard sat in his command chair, sipping Earl Grey tea as he reviewed the day's reports on his PADD.

"Standard patrol of the Neutral Zone, Captain," Worf reported from tactical, his deep voice carrying its usual gravitas. "No unusual activity detected."

It was meant to be a routine mission—monitoring the border between Federation and Romulan space. The kind of assignment that usually had Commander Riker suppressing yawns. But something felt different today, though Data couldn't quite quantify what his neural networks were detecting.

## Scene 1: Normal Day on the Enterprise/Voyager

"Number One," Picard addressed his first officer, "what's your assessment of the crew's performance during yesterday's emergency drills?"

Before Riker could respond, Counselor Troi shifted uncomfortably in her seat. Her empathic abilities were picking up... something. A disturbance? No, more like an absence—as if pieces of the emotional landscape around her were simply missing.

"Captain," she began, her voice carrying a note of uncertainty, "I'm sensing—" She paused, struggling to find the right words. "It's as if there are gaps in the fabric of..."

## Scene 2: The Quantum Anomaly

"Sir!" Data's voice cut through the tension. "Sensors are detecting a quantum fluctuation directly ahead. The readings are... unusual."

The viewscreen shifted to show what appeared to be a ripple in space, like heat waves rising from hot pavement—if that pavement were the very fabric of reality itself.

"Unusual how, Mr. Data?" Picard stood, tugging his uniform jacket in his characteristic gesture.
[ed: LOVE THIS]

"The anomaly appears to be generating temporal inversions on a quantum level, but..." Data's head tilted slightly, "the pattern suggests it's not a natural phenomenon. There are signs of algorithmic regularity."

"Shields up," Riker commanded, but Worf's fingers had already moved to the controls.

"Shields are not responding as expected, Commander," Worf reported, frustration evident in his voice. "Power levels are fluctuating."

## Scene 3: Reality Starts to Bend

The first sign that something was terribly wrong came when Ensign Crusher's console began displaying cascading symbols—familiar yet wrong, like a corrupted memory.

"Captain," Wesley frowned at his station, "something's wrong with the navigation interface."

Data's hands moved with increasing speed across his console. His head tilted slightly, a subtle indication that even his positronic brain was struggling to process what he was seeing. "Captain, the quantum irregularities are expanding exponentially."

The bridge lighting flickered. In that moment of darkness, each crew member experienced a disorienting sense of déjà vu—as if seeing themselves from multiple angles at once. Counselor Troi pressed her fingers to her temples, overwhelmed by the psychic echo.
[more subtle]

"All hands," Picard's voice remained steady despite the chaos unfolding around them, "this is the Captain. We are experiencing some form of—"

The ship shuddered. Through the viewscreen, stars winked out in impossible patterns, leaving behind vast stretches of empty void. Data's movements became erratic, his normally fluid gestures stuttering like a corrupted hologram.

"Sir," Data's voice carried an unusual note of strain, "I am detecting... patterns within... patterns..." His eyes rolled back, and for the first time in his existence, the android lost consciousness.
